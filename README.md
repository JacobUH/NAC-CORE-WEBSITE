Welcome to the NAC Core website repository! This project serves as the official site for NAC Core, a student-led organization dedicated to reducing feline overpopulation through Trap-Neuter-Return (TNR) and community education. The site is designed to inform the public about our mission, upcoming events, and ways to get involved or donate.
